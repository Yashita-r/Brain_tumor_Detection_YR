# Brain_tumor_Detection_YR
Building a Brain Tumor Detection project using Python and Jupyter Notebook involves utilizing image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and classify brain tumor images. 
Data Collection:
Gathered a dataset of brain tumor images. This dataset should include images with both tumor and non-tumor cases.Used datasets like the "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection" dataset on platforms like Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing:
Loaded the dataset and preprocess the images. Resizd the images to a consistent size, normalize pixel values, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Building:
Utilized machine learning or deep learning techniques to build a brain tumor detection model.Used libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. Defined the architecture of the model, compile it, and train it on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the trained model on the testing dataset to measure its performance. Calculated metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction and Visualization:
Implemented code to load an image (brain MRI) for prediction. Preprocessed the image as shown in the earlier code snippet. Used the trained model to make predictions and display the image along with the predicted class and confidence.

Display Images:
Utilized the code snippet provided earlier for displaying images horizontally in a new window. This can help you display test images along with predictions in a clear and organized manner.
